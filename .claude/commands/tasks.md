Read `social/tasks.json` and display or modify the task board.

## Commands
- **Show tasks**: Display all tasks grouped by status (todo, inprogress, review, done)
- **Add task**: Add a new task with title, category, priority, and optional fields below
- **Move task**: Change a task's status (e.g., move "pub-01" to inprogress). Always set `statusChangedDate` to today when status changes.
- **Complete task**: Mark a task as done with today's date
- **Filter**: Show tasks by category, channel, campaign, or approvalStatus

## Task file
The source of truth is `social/tasks.json` (schema v2.0). Always read it before making changes. After any modification, write the updated JSON back and update `lastUpdated`.

The dashboard at `http://localhost:3333` polls tasks.json every 3 seconds via `task-server.js`, so changes you make here appear in the browser automatically.

## Required fields
- `id` — format: category-prefix + number (e.g., "pub-04", "infra-08")
- `title` — human-readable task name
- `category` — see categories below
- `status` — todo | inprogress | review | done | blocked
- `priority` — high | medium | low
- `created` — "YYYY-MM-DD"
- `statusChangedDate` — "YYYY-MM-DD" — set to today whenever status changes

## Optional fields (schema v2.0)

- `dueDate` — "YYYY-MM-DD" — deadline for ships-this-week tracking
- `approvalStatus` — "not-needed" | "pending" | "approved" | "rejected" — set to "pending" when moving to review
- `sop` — SOP reference (e.g., "SOP-05")
- `cluster` — content cluster slug (can coexist with campaign)

## Categories
